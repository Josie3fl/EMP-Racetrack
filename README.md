EMP Racatrack was made to both track, maintain and create employees records for a company. The name originated from the source of competition tha drives people to grow further in theirs careers. Hopefully keeping this mindset in as many companies as possible that promoting from within is as important than sourcing from the outside environment of a workforce.
The app solves a few issues, employee information can be displayed on the terminal with ease and with fast access. Information can be filtered for various topics and new information can be added based on company need. While building the app I learned that is very important to use the correct code framing since I started using some old format of building this app that would've taking me forever to figure out. Imports have the facility of making your code communicate faster from one file to the next.
